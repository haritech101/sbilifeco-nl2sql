            description: The name of the region, which could be a city, district or state. Queries will often use the name of a region to match against.

This field is a master value and will need to be enumerated before other queries about regions.

            type: string
            description: The name of the zone to which this region belongs. Zone is a master value and its exhaustive list needs to be queried beforehand.
